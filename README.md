# Author gender classification in Persian
In this project, I have developed a 3-channel neural network model with keras to classify the author as Male/Female.

The reason behind using a multi-chanel model, is to proceed with documents in different resolutions or n-grams at each time step by defining different kernel sizes for each channelâ€™s convolutional layer.
